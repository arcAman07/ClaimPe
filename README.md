## Problem
Every day we have many insurance claims being requested by different people for various purposes. The process is very simple and anyone with good internet access can claim for any insurance. However, there is no mechanism to verify whether the claim is genuine or not. As a result, we have many fraud claims in society. Hence, we have come up with this project called ClaimPe.

## Solution

ClaimPe is a simple web application which detects whether a user's insurance claim is fake or not. If frauds reduce, claim ratio improves, it makes a case for lower premium. To handle the fraud cases, we have created a business model that will not only reduce the misuse of policy claims but also benefit the insurance company in many ways. 
When a policy holder applies for an insurance claim from our app, the app makes them stake some amount of coins/cash until his/hers claim gets approved. By doing this we ensure: 
The faulty claims are prevented, as the fraudsters would not risk staking money as they know their claims are faulty.

### How do we detect faulty claims?
We use our advanced fraud analytical engine which combines business rules, predictive modeling, anomaly detection and analysis to uncover hidden relationships, detect subtle patterns of behavior and prioritize suspicious cases.
If our detection model finds the claim suspicious it increases the stake amount so now the claimers will have a bigger amount to stake for a longer period of time.
If, our model finds that the claim isnâ€™t suspicious the amount to be stacked is low so that the users would not have to think twice while staking

### How do we benefit?
As the claim process takes time The staked amount will be with our company, this amount further can be used to give loans or to provide further insurances which is currently kept as a future scope.
